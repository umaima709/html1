    <H1>MYSELF</H1>
    <P>My <i>name</i> is <B>UMAIMA KHAN</B>. I am <b>26</b> years old. I attend school at city High. I am a IT student.
        I live with
        my parents and two young brothers. I own a pet dog who is friendly enough. My favourite place at home is the
        backyard. I spent a maximum of my time lying down with a book in the park.</P>
    <p>My <i>hobbies</i> include painting, humming with the strings of the guitar, playing video games, learning about
        new
        words. I am very fond of cosmology and spent my time reading books on space and galaxies. My bookshelf is a mini
        galaxy. Someday I wish to float in space where no force acts upon me.</p>
    <p>As a <i>responsible</i> citizen, I always keep a note of the current affairs happening in my country. I read the
        newspaper every day. I think a human being should be responsible enough to educate themselves of the wonders and
        utility holes of the world.</p>
